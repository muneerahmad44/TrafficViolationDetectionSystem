-cd to the folder "TrafficViolationDetectionSystem" and run this commadn from ther terminal "PYTHONPATH=. python3 main.py" and it will save the output video to the same folder 

- future work is to extract no pate save in database and generate and e challan for that registered car 
- to improve the performance of the hekemt detection and number pate detection 
- to integrate multiple cctv cameras and use gpus and real time cctv camera stream to get the resullts
